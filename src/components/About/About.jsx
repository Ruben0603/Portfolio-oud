                    <p> I'm a 21-year-old software development student at ROC Nijmegen, currently in my third year. My main focus is on frontend development, where I have experience with tools like React, Vue.js, and CSS frameworks like Tailwind and Bootstrap. Additionally, I also have some experience with backend technologies, including PHP with Laravel, Symfony, and a bit of C# with ASP.NET.

                    <br/><br/>I'm always looking for new opportunities to enhance my skills and grow as a developer. Let's talk tech and build something amazing together! ðŸš€</p>
